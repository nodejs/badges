# Badges Initiative

This is the organizational repository for the Node.js Badges Strategic Initiative, as chartered under the [Community Committee].

Because of interest expressed in [committee/working-group logos](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/529) and [contributor/event badges](https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/issues/212#issuecomment-366805114) – and the success of existing achievement rewards like the [first time contributor pin](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/DN9YuC-XkAE4WSi.jpg) – this initiative is tasked with facilitating the design, development and production of Node.js Open Badges, committee and working group logos, and all associated merchandise and paraphernalia required to further encourage contribution and community engagement.

These responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
 - Management of the Node.js [Open Badges] account;
 - The new badge approval and release process;
 - Asset creation and style guide standards;
 - Badge award processes;
 - Development and Maintenance of badge issuance automation tooling;
 - Production and distribution of stickers, pins, and related products created from content that emerges from this initiative.
